Goddamn it.

"What now, Cee-Ri?" I said to the button on my collar as I got up. The thick green grass of this planet felt really nice to lie down on. I can almost see the silver glint of my starship orbiting this planet's moon, four hundred thousand kilometers above me.

"Master Tripp, this planet is not within Federation or Allied Space. Please consider getting back on board."

"No, Cee-Ri. Stay in orbit and I'll be right back."

"Did you mean: Stay in orbit and port me right back?"

"Very funny." My ship's AI really needs to be tweaked. "Where's the nearest civilized outpost?"

"Several lightyears away, Master Tripp. Did you mean: Nearest group of oil-guzzling Class-Zero human-like beings?"

There was a concrete-like road leading to the "city". It was far too small to be adequately called one, but from what I saw from orbit, this is one of the largest centers of population here. 

I passed quite a bit of traffic as I walked forward, and as I neared the city, I noticed that the people's transportation here was streamlined and used refined light metals.

"Cee-Ri." Another large land transport passed me. None of the humans here even noticed me as I walked beside the road.

"Yes, Master Tripp?"

"Online your cloak. The people here are nearing Class-One, they might notice the ship."

"At once, Master Tripp. May I recommend activating your SAT?"

"Turn it on. How long before the Speech here is Analyzed and Translated to Common?"

"About 2 planetary cycles, Master Tripp. I strongly advise staying for far less time than that, Sir."

As I entered the city, my collar picked up the sounds of the city and started piecing things together. My contacts also started picking apart the glyphs that this world used, although it seemed to become confused after a while.

"What now, Cee-Ri?" I had to whisper to my hand, since there were already some people walking alongside me.

"Some of the debris in this planet's atmosphere seems to be man-made, albeit very underpowered- about a thousandth of one energy unit. Some of them are transmitting on the low channels."

That's curious. They accomplised limited space flight using a very limited, very dangerous, entropy-positive resource. Innovative.

"Something's up with my SAT's glyph module." 

"Master Tripp, the human-like beings of this planet seems to have several glyph collections. They have not standardized their languages yet."

"Ah. I see."
